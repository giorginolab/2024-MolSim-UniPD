## How to run

The code contained in this repo is structure in large part as IPython notebooks. They can be run in three ways:

* On your local machine. That's probably the easiest and most didactic for interpreting the intermediate files.
* On [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Fki7NjHlhYYqGWHdGakUJuu0TP40YdIC#scrollTo=sEPay7j6oqf-). Just open Colab and point it to the file's URL. Simulations run much faster if you request a GPU runtime.
* On Binder. Somewhat slow but comes with a pre-installed environment. [Open in binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/giorginolab/MD-Tutorial-Data/binderenv?urlpath=git-pull%3Frepo%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fgithub.com%252Fgiorginolab%252F2024-MolSim-UniPD%26urlpath%3Dlab%252Ftree%252F2024-MolSim-UniPD%252F%26branch%3Dmain)

## Day 2

Here are the links:

* Analysis with MDTraj: https://github.com/giorginolab/MD-Tutorial-Data/blob/main/notebooks/2_MDTraj_analysis.ipynb . If "open in Colab" does not work automatically, manually open Colab and point it to said address.
* Docking: https://github.com/giorginolab/2024-MolSim-UniPD/blob/main/docking/Docking_2024.ipynb or https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1J0at4RhO00BUUI1r1MR6N5sfZdLPZLgj#scrollTo=p0YeFvWR-2aB . Same as above.
