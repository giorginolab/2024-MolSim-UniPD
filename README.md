## How to run

The code contained in this repo is structure in large part as IPython notebooks. They can be run in three ways:

* On your local machine. That's probably the easiest and most didactic for interpreting the intermediate files.
* On [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Fki7NjHlhYYqGWHdGakUJuu0TP40YdIC#scrollTo=sEPay7j6oqf-). Just open Colab and point it to the file's URL. Simulations run much faster if you request a GPU runtime.
* On Binder. Somewhat slow but comes with a pre-installed environment.
